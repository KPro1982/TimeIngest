    "body": "  CAUTION: This email originated from outside the organization. \r\n  Do not click links or open attachments unless you are expecting them from the sender. \r\n\r\n\r\nHello Mark: I am following up to my voicemail I left for you earlier this afternoon on your cell phone. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI believe we are in agreement to the fundamental issues about the terms of the protective order and we can resolve the concerns you presented.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA) We agree on the  categories of documents you propose are presumptively confidential. We would like to add private personal information of third parties/witness remain confidential. \r\n\r\n            (1)  private info in the officers' personnel files; \r\n\r\n            (2)  incidents of \"alleged officer misconduct\"; and \r\n\r\n            (3)  medical records; and  \r\n\r\n            (4) private personal information of third parties/witnesses. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nB) In regards to your concerns about handling confidential materials at the end of litigation, the agreement provides for an alternative to having to return the materials to the designated party. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“In the alternative, at the discretion of the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party may destroy some or all of the Protected Material instead of returning it – unless such Protected Material is an original, in which case, the Receiving Party must obtain the Producing Party’s written consent before destroying such original Protected Material.” (At pp. 17-18) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe do ask that the parties notify each other after the end of litigation confirming whether the materials were returned or destroyed. To streamline this task, I can draft a writing in advance to use when the time comes. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn regards to your position about DPs having to be subject as the same burdens as RPs, listed in  section 5.5, the order explains that all parties must comply with the requirements of CRC, rules 2.550 and 2.551 (at p. 11). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Nothing in this Protective Order shall be construed as any entitlement for the Parties to file any documents or materials under seal; nor shall the Parties’ Stipulation or this Protective Order be construed as any exemption from any of the requirements of California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551.  The Parties are required to comply with the applicable Local Court Rules in their entirety.”  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPursuant to the terms of the proposed protective order, the only documents that would need to be filed under seal are those within the limited categories of documents that the parties agree are confidential.  A party is free to file their own confidential documents as exhibits to a motion without doing so under seal, but that would obviously waive the protections. We agree that “some personal documents--like letters from Coy to his family--should not be passed around indiscriminately, but would not need to be sealed if used in a court proceeding.”   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt this time we do not propose any other categories of documents the City views as confidential, other than the PPI of third parties/witnesses, as mentioned above.  We agree with you that FPD’s policies and procedures on use of force are not confidential.  Thank you for proposing that plaintiff will agree that a listing of categories now would not bar a party from adding to the list at a later time. I will add a statement to the proposed protective order to such affect.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we request that we continue to meet and confer about the terms of the proposed protective order, file it as soon as feasible for the court’s approval, and then produce documents. I believe we are close and in line to what we trust the court would approve. The request is not intended to withhold any materials from plaintiff. We want to assure the we preserve the sensitive nature of the issues for all the several involved parties. Please reach out to me if you wish for me to clarify anything. My celI is 415-637-3290. I look forward to working this out with you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNichole Santiago\r\nPartner\r\n\r\n\r\nOne California St., Suite 900\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94111\r\nMain: (415) 217-6990 | Ext.: 4632\r\n\r\nNichole.Santiago@manningkass.com <mailto:Nichole.Santiago@manningkass.com>  | manningkass.com <https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/LRZBCZ6oprhMY1gLSzfG_k> \r\n\r\nDallas | Los Angeles | New York | Orange County | Phoenix | San Diego | San Francisco\r\n\r\nNote: This e-mail is covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. 2510-2521 and is legally privileged.

Plaintiff is willing to sign an order along the terms proposed but not the current form.  In this email, I want to (a) note the burdensome nature of the Order, (b) identify the provisions to which plaintiff objects, and (c) identify the categories of documents at issue so we can reach agreement on their handling.  If we can agree on how specific documents will be handled, that will hope define the scope of an Agreement whose terms could be read very broadly .  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(A):  Burdensome nature of agreement. \r\n\r\nI assume the confidentiality agreement comes from a basic form that has grown over the years to its current unwieldy size.  In its current form, it is inaccessible to the layperson so that giving people copies of the Order (as required by §5.3) would not put them on notice.  Most readers will be challenged by a document with sentences that are routinely 5 and 6 lines long and filled with legalese and/or needless provisions. (For example, documents remain confidential until the Designating party says so. Yet §2 states that confidentiality remains in place \"even after final disposition\" and provides a lengthy definition of \"final disposition.\" all of which is irrelevant and even misleading.)  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(B) Terms to which Plaintiff Objects. \r\n\r\n Plaintiff will sign the agreement with the following changes: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Final Disposition rules:  We will not agree to return all copies of all confidential documents at the end of the litigation, nor will we aver that we have complied with the Agreement.  It is my standard practice to recycle all documents produced after a case is truly finished.  Moreover, we know our duties as the Receiving Party, and we will  abide by any order of the Court.  We will not sign further statements saying that we did what we promised. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Per §5.3, we will notify witnesses and everyone working on the case that if documents are marked confidential, then the subject matter is confidential and can only be discussed in a strictly limited context.  However, the best way to communicate that information must be left to Plaintiff's discretion. Passing out copies of the Order would rarely be effective given that the document is a challenge to read even for a motivated litigator.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3. Section 5.5 says that, when filing privileged materials with the court, Receiving Parties have to comply with Cal rule of Court 2.550 and 2.551 but the Designating Party need not do so, effectively waiving the protection.  This is not acceptable.  If RPs have to jump through these hoops, so do the DPs.  If the document should not have been labeled as confidential to begin with, or if the DP is willing to waive that protection rather than conform with the burdensome rules the DP insisted upon, then the time to waive confidentiality is NOW, or at least before we start filing documents under seal.  It's important that the court sees the documents that the DP has been labeling confidential.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(C)   Categories of Documents that Plaintiff agrees are presumptively confidential: \r\n\r\n Plaintiff agrees that the three categories identified in the Order (at p. 11) are to be treated as presumptively confidential:  \r\n\r\n\t(1)  private info in the officers' personnel files; \r\n\r\n\t(2)  incidents of \"alleged officer misconduct\" [what I think of as Pitchess materials]; and \r\n\r\n\t(3)  medical records. (Note: the HIPAA statute governs all the medical information and may preempt a lot of the Order.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAre there any other categories of documents the City views as confidential?   Specifically, Plaintiff is about to serve discovery requesting all the FPD's policies and procedures on use of force.  Is the City going to contend that those are confidential?  I do not want to get into a situation where I can't quote from FPD's policy manual in a summary judgment brief, especially since I'm sure the policies have been published in numerous trials and are, most likely, a rehash of POST standards.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff will agree that a listing of categories now would not bar a party from adding to the list at a later time.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(D) Can we have a category of confidential documents that do NOT need to be sealed if used in a filing or at trial? \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I was thinking that some personal documents--like letters from Coy to his family--should not be passed around indiscriminately, but would not need to be sealed if used in a court proceeding.  I think the party producing the documents should be able to choose that more limited protection. I don't think we need to change the Agreement to accomplish this provided we can agree to this in an email. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf we cannot agree, it bears remembering that Rule of Court imposes a heavy burden on the party seeking a protective order: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Plaintiff will sign the proposed Order if our three comments are accepted and if we can identify the categories of documents to be labeled confidential. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLMK if you want to talk, although for now, a written record is useful. \r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nmark \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

Namely, in this case, the time records provided by the staffing employer literally list that my client was owed meal premium wages for some shifts he was subjected to violations and the time records also show other shifts where my client was also subjected to violations. For example, on the timecard dated November 17, 2023, it is written on the timecard that meal break premium wages are owed for three shifts, but meal break premium wages were not paid. Additionally, on the time entry for December 4, 2023, it is again written that meal premium wages are owed for that shift. And again, as another example, on December 14, 2023, the time entry literally shows that my client worked over 12 hours and there is a note written, “*Cannot Waive Lunch,” on the time entry, it is also again written that my client is owed meal break premium wages on the time entry for this date. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDespite knowing and writing, in its own records, that meal break premium wages are owed for specific dates, the payroll records confirm that these known and owed premium wages were never paid. Accordingly, my client is owed these meal break premium wages, waiting time penalties ($8,400 alone), and attorney fees, at a bare minimum. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMoreover, for the other shifts that show meal break violations and that do not have a note written, the joint employers will need to prove, with evidence, that my client chose to take a non-compliant meal period – an insurmountable burden. Outside of these wages remaining unpaid, Mr. Moody is still owed additional wages for the occasions he was required to obtain materials from the warehouse in the evenings in preparation for the next day’s work. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMy client also remains firm that he is still owed expense reimbursements. He clarified that $1,200 of what he requested during the employment remains unreimbursed to date. He was also never reimbursed for required cell phone use. As you know, my client is entitled to attorney fees per LC 2802 (c), plus the reimbursement. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn any event, I’ve been authorized to reduce my client’s settlement demand to $12,500 in response. He invites the joint employers to propose a reasonable and equitable counteroffer as early as possible, but no later than five (5) business days from today’s date.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNick Badii Associate Attorney\r\nLawyers for Employee and Consumer Rights\r\nwww.lawyersforemployeeandconsumerrights.com <https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Jy1DCW6lmohj8G9xTxMhwi> \r\n3500 West Olive Avenue, Third Floor • Burbank, California 91505\r\n(323) 521-4116 direct • (323) 375-5101 general • (323) 306-5571 facsimile\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION:\r\nThe information contained in this email message is legally privileged and confidential information intended only for the use of the individual or entity named above.

Tek Systems and Quest have authorized me to convey a joint offer to resolve Mr. Moody’s claims globally for $2,000, which would represent $1,000 each from Tek and Quest. Counsel for Tek Systems is cc:d on this email. This would be a full release as to both Tek Systems and Quest. We look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDaniel J. Cravens\r\nFresno Managing Partner\r\n\r\n8050 N.
